Great question! Apart from **Classification, Regression, and Clustering**, there are other types of Machine Learning problems, each with its own specialized algorithms.  

## **üìå Different ML Problem Types & Algorithms**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Classification (Categorizing things) ‚Üí Supervised Learning**  
- **Goal:** Assign labels/categories to data.  
- **Example:** Is this email spam or not?  
- **Algorithms:**  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Trees  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Neural Networks (for deep learning classification)

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Regression (Predicting numerical values) ‚Üí Supervised Learning**  
- **Goal:** Predict a continuous number.  
- **Example:** Predict house prices based on area and location.  
- **Algorithms:**  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Trees (Regression)  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering (Grouping similar things) ‚Üí Unsupervised Learning**  
- **Goal:** Find natural groupings in the data.  
- **Example:** Segment customers based on shopping behavior.  
- **Algorithms:**  
  - **K-Means**  
  - **DBSCAN** (Density-Based Clustering)  
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Anomaly Detection (Detecting unusual patterns) ‚Üí Unsupervised Learning**  
- **Goal:** Identify outliers or rare events.  
- **Example:** Fraud detection in credit card transactions.  
- **Algorithms:**  
  - Isolation Forest  
  - One-Class SVM  
  - Autoencoders (Deep Learning)

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Dimensionality Reduction (Simplifying Data) ‚Üí Unsupervised Learning**  
- **Goal:** Reduce large feature sets while keeping important information.  
- **Example:** Reducing 1000 features to 10 while keeping key patterns.  
- **Algorithms:**  
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)  
  - t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)  
  - LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)  

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Reinforcement Learning (Making decisions over time) ‚Üí Different from Supervised/Unsupervised**  
- **Goal:** Learn through trial and error to maximize rewards.  
- **Example:** A robot learning to walk or AI playing chess.  
- **Algorithms:**  
  - Q-Learning  
  - Deep Q Networks (DQN)  
  - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)  

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendation Systems (Suggesting things) ‚Üí Supervised/Unsupervised Hybrid**  
- **Goal:** Recommend items based on past behavior.  
- **Example:** Netflix suggesting movies, Amazon recommending products.  
- **Algorithms:**  
  - Collaborative Filtering  
  - Content-Based Filtering  
  - Matrix Factorization (SVD)
