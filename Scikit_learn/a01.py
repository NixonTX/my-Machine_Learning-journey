# X_train, y_train : features and target values used for training the model.
# X_test, y_test : features and target values used for testing the model after it has been trained.

# test_size=0.4: 40% of the data is allocated to the testing set while the remaining 60% is used for training.

# random_state=1: This ensures that the split is consistent, meaning youâ€™ll get the same random split every time you run the code.
